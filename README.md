PostgreSQL Replication - The Ultimate Guide
Replication in PostgreSQL allows data to be copied from a primary server to one or more standby servers for high availability, backups, and performance optimization.

Types of Replication
Streaming Replication
Description: Full database copy using WAL logs.

Logical Replication
Description: Only selected tables are copied.

Method 1: Streaming Replication (Full Database Copy)
Step 1: Configure Primary Server (Sender)
Edit postgresql.conf

ini
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_keep_size = 256MB
hot_standby = on
synchronous_standby_names = '*'
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'cp %p /archive/%f'
synchronous_commit = on
hot_standby_feedback = on
max_replication_slots = 10
wal_log_hints = on
wal_sender_timeout = 30s
wal_receiver_timeout = 30s
Edit pg_hba.conf (Access Rules)

ini
host    replication    replicator    0.0.0.0/0    md5     
Create Replication User

sql
CREATE USER replicator REPLICATION LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
Restart PostgreSQL

bash
systemctl restart postgresql
Step 2: Configure Standby Server (Receiver)
Copy data from the primary server:

bash
PGPASSWORD='<password>' pg_basebackup -h <Primary-IP> -U replicator -D /var/lib/postgresql/15/main -P -R
Restart PostgreSQL on both servers:

bash
systemctl restart postgresql
ðŸŽ‰ Streaming Replication is ready! ðŸš€

Method 2: Logical Replication (Selected Tables Only)
Step 1: Configure Primary Server (Sender)
Create Replication User

sql
CREATE USER replicator REPLICATION LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
Create Publication for Selected Tables

sql
CREATE PUBLICATION my_pub FOR TABLE users, orders;
Grant Permission to Replicator

sql
GRANT SELECT ON public.users TO replicator;
GRANT SELECT ON public.orders TO replicator;
Step 2: Configure Standby Server (Receiver)
Create Replication User

sql
CREATE USER replicator REPLICATION LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
Create Subscription to Receive Data

sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_sub
CONNECTION 'host=<Primary-IP> port=5432 dbname=mydb user=replicator password=yourpassword'
PUBLICATION my_pub;
Restart PostgreSQL on both servers:

bash
systemctl restart postgresql
ðŸŽ‰ Logical Replication is now active! ðŸš€

Troubleshooting & Tips
Issue	Solution
Cannot connect to primary server	Check pg_hba.conf & firewall rules.
Data not replicating	Ensure wal_level = replica and max_wal_senders is set correctly.
Logical replication not working	Verify publication and subscription names match.
Standby server lags behind	Increase wal_keep_size.
Standby queries are slow	Set hot_standby_feedback = on.
Final Summary
âœ… Streaming Replication is for full database sync.

âœ… Logical Replication is for selective table replication.

âœ… Follow these steps carefully, and your PostgreSQL Replication will work smoothly! ðŸš€
